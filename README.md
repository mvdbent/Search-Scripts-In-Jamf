# Search-Scripts-In-Jamf

This script is designed to search for a string in all the scripts and or extension attributes in your Jamf Pro instance. It will use the Jamf Pro Classic API to get the list of scripts and iterate through all of them to find the string you’re looking for. The result will show the number of scripts or extension attributes (or both if you use the combined script) containing the string but also for each script the lines and the URL and ID of the element in Jamf Pro.

## General Requirements:

It is recommended to have a specific account that can only read your scripts.

## Settings

Before using the script, there are 3 variables to modify to suit your needs:
- `serverURL` to give the URL of your Jamf Pro server, for example, if you’re hosted in Jamfcloud that would be something like `https://foo.jamfcloud.com`. If you have a specific URL and a specific port, make sure to add it here too.
- `userName` to give the name of the account used to authenticate and access the scripts. As mentioned previously, it is recommended to have a dedicated account for that as the credentials will be in the script in plain text (even if mostly that script will be executed from an admin computer)
- `userPasswd` to give the password of the account

You can also execute the script and if you didn't fill the variables, it will ask for the relevant informations (URL, username and password)

Don’t forget to make the script executable: 
`chmod u+x /path/to/searchScriptsInJamf.sh`

***Warning***
The script will not work if you try to launch it using `sh /path/to/searchScriptsInJamf.sh`
Either make it executable or use `bash /path/to/searchScriptsInJamf.sh`

## Usage

Simply execute the script with one parameter being the string you’re looking for. If you don’t have a parameter, the script will ask you for one and if you don't enter anything it will search for the occurrences of `python`:

```/path/to/searchScriptsInJamf.sh "dscl"
You have 12 scripts in your instance of Jamf Pro
